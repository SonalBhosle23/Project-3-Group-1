An overview of the project and its purpose

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

At least one paragraph summarising efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

This project demonstrates...., primarily by the means of visulisation. 

### Introduction
There  


### Research questions:
At least 3 research questions to be answered using at least 3 unique views (requirement: A minimum of three unique views present the data. (10 points))


### Data preparation

The original data was extracted (E) from data.world....consists of 8790 types of food (requirement: The dataset contains at least 100 unique records. (5 points))
The final data is stored in the database (requirement: A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). (5 points))

### Data visualisation for answering the research questions
Requirements:

A minimum of three unique views present the data. (10 points)

The visualisations are presented in a clear, digestible manner. (5 points)

The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels. (10 points)

In order to find out.... we used line, bar, and map graphs/visualisations be able to draw insights from the data.

** interactive visulisations: such as Module 14/15 challenges, add in one more visualisation using a library not covered in the class.

### Data ethics considered

During the process of working on the project, we are constantly aware of data ethics such as...

### Usability requirements (may overlapping with the previous points)
The script, notebook, or webpage created to showcase data visualisations runs without error. (10 points)

The project includes some level of user-driven interaction, conforming to one of the following designs: (10 points)

HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualisations

Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

Visualisations created from user-selected filtered data
